How to benchmark with this software
1. Choose a language, it is usually advised to choose the fastest language you can.
    Alternatively, you can use a precompiled build in the releases page, these are not fully consistent and are not recommended for benchmarking.
2. Add a limit to the loop i.e. 100,000
3. (Optional) Add a built in timer to print the time the program took to run. The compiled Rust builds have this already built in
4. Run the program.
